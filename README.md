# Dimentional Exile
A game created by Dirk 'mrDLSable' Schut in order to learn how to use Unity3D. The end goal is to create an incremental type game with crafting and combat and skills and fighting and a lot of other things.

## Contributing
Forking this branch and making edits in it yourself is highly encouraged. This project was made to learn and as such I want others to learn as well. That said, because this project was made to learn, it is unlikely that I will be accepting many pull requests. If you have made a feature in a fork that you would like to see implemented in the base game, you can make a pull request and I will see about implementing it manually.
